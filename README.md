## Because WordPress is awesome, but the_loop isn't
Timber is a WordPress theme that uses the [Twig Templating Engine](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/). This helps clean-up your theme code so your single.php file can focus on your WordPress model, while your single.html file can focus 100% on the HTML and display.

### What does it look like?
Nothing. Timber is meant for you to build a child theme on. Like the [Starkers](https://github.com/viewportindustries/starkers) or [Boilerplate theme](https://github.com/zencoder/html5-boilerplate-for-wordpress) it comes style-free, because you're the style expert. Instead, Timber handles the logic you need to make a kick-ass looking site.

### Who is it good for?
Timber is great for teams of designers and developers working together. At Upstatement not everyone knows the ins-and-outs of the_loop(), WordPress codex and PHP (nor should they). With Timber your best WordPress dev can focus on building the .php files with requests from WordPress and pass the data into .html files. Once there, designers can easily mark-up data and build out a site's look-and-feel.

### Should I use it?
Well, it's **free**! And it's GPL-licensed, so use in personal or commerical work. Just don't re-sell it.
